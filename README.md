# iocage-Backup-Script
 This repository contains a shell script designed to automate the backup process for jails in TrueNAS Core. The script utilizes the `iocage` commands to export jails, create date-stamped backup files, manage these backups within a designated dataset, and perform cleanup by purging older backups.
